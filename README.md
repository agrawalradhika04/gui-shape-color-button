# gui-shape-color-button
This program creates a simple interactive Java GUI that allows users to control the color and shape of a drawn object using two groups of buttons. The application uses the JButton and JPanel components from the Swing library to build the interface. Users can change the color of the shape by clicking on one of the buttons labeled Red, Green, or Blue. Users can choose between three shapes â€” Oval, Rectangle, and Line. The selected color and shape are immediately reflected in the central drawing area (JPanel), which repaints dynamically based on the current user selection. This is a standalone GUI application with no external dependencies, ideal for demonstrating the use of event-driven programming and custom painting in Java.
